###NASA’s Fermi and NuSTAR space telescopes, together with another satellite named BRITE-Toronto, are providing new insights into a nova explosion that erupted in 2018. Detailed measurements of bright flares in the explosion clearly show that shock waves power most of the nova's visible light.



Unprecedented observations of a nova outburst in 2018 by a trio of satellites, including NASA’s Fermi and NuSTAR space telescopes, have captured the first direct evidence that most of the explosion’s visible light arose from shock waves — abrupt changes of pressure and temperature formed in the explosion debris.

A nova is a sudden, short-lived brightening of an otherwise inconspicuous star. It occurs when a stream of hydrogen from a companion star flows onto the surface of a white dwarf, a compact stellar cinder not much larger than Earth.
